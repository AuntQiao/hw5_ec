        A math-learning mini-game built with Konva.js and a full MVC architecture. Players must identify number patterns 
        under time pressure to unlock levels and progress through the game.

        I designed the UI, game logic, question-generation system, and integrated animations and state management. 
        This was developed as part of a software engineering team project at UCSD.
